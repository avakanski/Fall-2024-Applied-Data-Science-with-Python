    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is widely used for managing source code for software projects. Git enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously and independently, and it tracks changes made by each contributor. It provides features such as branching, merging, and history tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Git, each developer has a local copy of the entire project history. Developers can work offline, commit changes locally, and then synchronize with a central repository later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of Git include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manage projects with repositories\n",
    "- Clone a project to work on a local copy\n",
    "- Control and track changes with staging and committing\n",
    "- Branch and merge for working on different parts and versions of a project\n",
    "- Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy\n",
    "- Push local updates to the main project\n",
    "\n",
    "A **repository** is typically used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets. I.e., they can contain anything your project needs. Repositories typically include a README file that provides information about the project. README files are written in plain text Markdown language."

    "**GitHub** is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers a graphical interface for managing Git repositories, collaboration features, and additional tools for project management. GitHub allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track issues, and manage pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of GitHub are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repository hosting: GitHub provides a place to store and manage Git repositories.\n",
    "- Collaboration: Developers can collaborate on projects by forking repositories, making changes, and submitting pull requests.\n",
    "- Issue Tracking: GitHub includes an issue-tracking system for managing bugs, feature requests, and other tasks.\n",
    "- Pull Requests: Developers can propose changes to a project by submitting pull requests, which can be reviewed and merged by project maintainers.\n",
    "- Web-based interface: GitHub provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with Git repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, Git serves as the version control system enabling developers to monitor code changes, whereas GitHub functions as a web-based platform offering hosting for Git repositories along with extra collaboration tools."

    "Step 3: Create a **branch**. By default, a repository comes with a primary branch called `\"main\"`, which serves as the authoritative branch. We have the option to establish additional branches stemming from the main branch within the repository. The creation of branches allows for the simultaneous existence of various versions of a project. This proves beneficial when incorporating new features into a project without altering the primary source code. Changes made in different branches remain isolated from the main branch until a later stage when merging is addressed. Branches provide a space for experimentation and editing before finalizing changes \n",

    "5) Click Create Pull Request.\n",
    "6) Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.\n",
    "7) Optionally, to the right of your title and description, click the button next to Reviewers, Assignees, Labels, Projects, or Milestone to add any of these options to your pull request. You do not need to add any, but these options offer different ways to collaborate using pull requests. \n",
