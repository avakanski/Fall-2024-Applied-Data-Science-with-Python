    "**Command Line Interface (CLI)** is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer system by typing commands. \n",

    "It's a way to give instructions to the computer using textual input. The command line is used to execute various commands, run programs, navigate the file system, and perform various tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's commonly found in operating systems like Unix, Linux, and Windows, where users can enter commands directly into the command-line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use CLI?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- CLI is more efficient for certain tasks, since we can execute the task with a single command instead of multiple clicks on different windows.  \n",

    "### Basic Definitions Related to CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminal:** A terminal is a software application that offers access to a CLI. It's the platform or environment in which the command line is displayed and utilized. Essentially, it's the visual medium that facilitates communication with the computer via the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shell:** A shell is a program designed to interpret and execute the commands entered by users through the command line. Acting as a command-line interpreter, it translates human-readable commands into instructions comprehensible by the operating system for execution. The shell also manages tasks like input and output redirection, environment variables, scripting, and various other functionalities. Different operating systems deploy distinct shell programs. For example, Unix-like systems typically utilize shells such as Bash, Zsh, or Fish, while Windows employs the Command Prompt and PowerShell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Console**: The console serves as the physical device that enables you to interact with the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the command line functions as a text-based instruction method, the terminal provides the visual interface for the command line, the shell is the program responsible for interpreting and executing input commands  through the command line, and the console is the computer screen, keyboard, mouse we use to interact with our computer.\n",
