    "A **virtual environment** is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them. Virtual environments create containers for each project, so that the Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts installed in one virtual environment are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, as well as they are isolated from the libraries and packages that are installed in the main Python installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, where we create and activate a virtual environment for a specific project, the project becomes an independent application, which is isolated from the system-installed Python and from all other Python libraries. This project-specific virtual environment provides its own Python interpreter, and its own pip to install libraries, separated from other Python libraries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By creating and managing separate environments for different projects, there is no chance of breaking currently installed packages in other environments. It also helps with reproducibility among developers and researchers working on large projects. For instance, if you have several different projects with their own virtual environments, they can have different versions of a library: for example, one project can use TensorFlow 1.12, and another can use TensorFlow 2.5. This way, we won't worry whether an update to the TensorFlow library in the main system-installed Python would impact the code in all our projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several tools for managing virtual environments. Python 3.3 provides a standard module `venv`, which is most commonly used for managing virtual environments. It allows to manage separate package versions for different projects. When creating a new project, we can simply create a new virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The full official documentation for `venv` can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)\n",
    "- The full official user guide for `venv` can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)\n",
    "- The PEP proposal for `venv` can be found [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for practical examples, it is recommended to consult the user guide. However, if you are looking for more information about specific details of `venv`, consulting the full documentation is recommended."
