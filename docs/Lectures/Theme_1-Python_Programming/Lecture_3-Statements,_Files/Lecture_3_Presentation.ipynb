    "1. Packages are composed of modules.\n",
    "2. Modules contain statements.\n",
    "3. Statements contain expressions.\n",
    "4. Expressions create and process objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Expressions** are part of statements that return a value, such as variables, operators, or function calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, expressions in Python include `2 + 5`, or `x + 3`, or `x * y` for given `x` and `y`, or `func1(3)` for a given function `func1`, since they all return a value. Expressions perform operations upon objects, and produce a value that can be used in other operations, can be assigned to a variable, printed out, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Statements** are sections of code that perform an action. The main goups of Python statements are: assignment statements, print statements, conditional statements (`if`, `break`, `continue`, `try`), and looping statements (`for`, `while`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `a = 2 + 5` is an assignment statement, because it doesn't return a value, but it performs an action by assigning the value `2 + 5` to the variable `a`. Note again that the statements don't return a value, in the way expressions do. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Modules** are Python files that contain Python statements, and are also called scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a module is a single Python script that is composed of a series of related statements grouped into one file.   \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Packages** are Python programs that collect related modules together within a single directory hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a package is a directory that contains a collection of module files.  A Python program can be organized into a single package, or more complex programs can use multiple packages to achieve its functionality."

In these languages, a compiler converts the statements in source files into binary machine code, which are afterwards executed by the computer hardware. Note that byte code files are different than binary machine code files. Consequently, running Python programs is slower than running C or C++ programs, because the code is interpreted as it is executed. On the other hand, writing and testing Python programs is faster and easier than writing and testing programs using compiled languages. (One last clarification: Python does compile source files, but the result is not a binary machine code, and because of that it is not considered a compiled language)."

    "As we mentioned earlier, there are several different implementations of the Python interpreter. They include CPython, Jython, IronPython, Stackless Python, and PyPy. CPython is the standard, original implementation of Python, Jython is a Python implementation targeted for integration with the Java programming language, IronPython was designed to allow Python programs to integrate with applications coded to work with Microsoft’s .NET Framework for Windows, etc."
